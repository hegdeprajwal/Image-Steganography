Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. 
In this project we are hiding the text data in an image and can be sent across to the reciever. When the reciever recieves the image they can decode the image to get the cipher text. 

Requirements :

pip install tk 
pip install Pillow

Steps to run : 
python3 ImageSteganography.py
